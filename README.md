# My First App

This repository contains my "first" app. It was a program for my TI-83+ graphing calculator that would essentially do my trigonometry homework for me.

I've preserved it here as a historical curiosity.

## Compiling

```
% git clone git@github.com:davedelong/triangle.git
% cd triangle
% gcc main.c -o triangle
% ./triangle
```
